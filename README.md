# Setup-Docker-Flask-SqlAlchmy-
I follow this tutorial to setup Docker falsk and sqlAlchmy.
Complete this tutorial on getting Docker, Flask, Postgres and SQLalchemy working together:

https://medium.com/@hmajid2301/implementing-sqlalchemy-with-docker-cb223a8296de (Links to an external site.)

You can use this as the basis for the 3 part tutorial, since the tutorial doesn't cover getting Docker, Flask, and Postgres setup.
